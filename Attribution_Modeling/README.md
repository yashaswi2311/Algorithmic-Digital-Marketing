# Criteo Attribution Modeling for Bidding Dataset

This dataset is released along with the paper:

"Attribution Modeling Increases Efficiency of Bidding in Display Advertising"
**Eustache Diemert&ast;, Julien Meynet&ast; (Criteo Research), Damien Lefortier (Facebook), Pierre Galland (Criteo) &ast;authors contributed equally**

This work was published in: 2017 AdKDD & TargetAd Workshop, in conjunction with The 23rd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2017) (https://adkdd17.wixsite.com/adkddtargetad2017)

## Content of this dataset
This dataset includes following files:

  * this **README.md** 
  * **criteo\_attribution\_dataset.tsv.gz**: the dataset itself (623M compressed)
  * **Experiments.ipynb**: ipython notebook with code and utilities to reproduce the results in the paper. Can also be used as a starting point for further research on this data. It requires python 3.* and standard scientific libraries such as pandas, numpy and sklearn.


## Data description
This dataset represent a sample of  30 days of Criteo live traffic data.  Each line corresponds to one impression (a banner) that was displayed to a user.
For each banner we have detailed information about the context, if it was clicked, if it led to a conversion and if it led to a conversion that was attributed to Criteo or not. Data has been sub-sampled and anonymized so as not to disclose proprietary elements.

Here is a detailed description of the fields (they are tab-separated in the file):

  * **timestamp**: timestamp of the impression (starting from 0 for the first impression). The dataset is sorted according to timestamp.
  *  **uid** a unique user identifier
  * **campaign** a unique identifier for the campaign
  * **conversion** 1 if there was a conversion in the 30 days after the impression (independently of whether this impression was last click or not)
  * **conversion_timestamp** the timestamp of the conversion or -1 if no conversion was observed
  *	**conversion_id**	a unique identifier for each conversion (so that timelines can be reconstructed if needed). -1 if there was no conversion
  * **attribution** 1 if the conversion was attributed to Criteo, 0 otherwise
  * **click** 1 if the impression was clicked, 0 otherwise
  *	**click_pos** the position of the click before a conversion (0 for first-click)
  * **click_nb** number of clicks. More than 1 if there was several clicks before a conversion
  * **cost** the price paid by Criteo for this display (**disclaimer:** not the real price, only a transformed version of it)
  *	 **cpo** the cost-per-order  in case of attributed conversion (**disclaimer:** not the real price, only a transformed version of it)
  * **time\_since\_last\_click** the time since the last click (in s) for the given impression
  *	 **cat[1-9]** contextual features associated to the display. Can be used to learn the click/conversion models. We do not disclose the meaning of these features but it is not relevant for this study. Each column is a categorical variable. In the experiments, they are mapped to a fixed dimensionality space using the Hashing Trick (see paper for reference).

### Key figures
  * 2,4Gb uncompressed
  * 16.5M impressions
  * 45K conversions
  * 700 campaigns
  
  

## Tasks
This dataset can be used in a large scope of applications related to Real-Time-Bidding, including but not limited to:

  * Attribution modeling: rule based, model based, etc...
  * Conversion modeling in display advertising: the data includes cost and value used for computing Utility metrics.
  * Offline metrics for real-time bidding
